color of a specific text or changing the background of a page.
Like adding some flavor to the blank HTML page.

  open and close tag

- to change color of a specific text you right call the
  text either by using which tag it is, using the id of a element
  or the class of a element.

  color:'The color you want'; inside the style section.
