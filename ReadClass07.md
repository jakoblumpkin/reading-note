Brother: Why can't a machine understand a normal web page?

ME: Because web pages are designed to be understood by people. A machine doesn't care about layout and styling. Machines basically just need the data. Ideally, every URL would have a human readable and a machine readable representation. When a machine GETs the resource, it will ask for the machine readable one. When a browser GETs a resource for a human, it will ask for the human readable one.

Brother: So people would have to make machine formats for all their pages?

ME: If it were valuable.

Look, we've been talking about this with a lot of abstraction. How about we take a real example. Imagine you are a teacher - at school you probably have a big computer system, or three or four computer systems more likely, that would let you manage students: what classes they're in, what grades they're getting, emergency contacts, information about the books you teach out of, etc. If the systems are web-based, then there's probably a URL for each of the nouns involved here: student, teacher, class, book, room, etc. Right now, getting the URL through the browser gives you a web page. If there were a machine readable representation for each URL, then it would be trivial to latch new tools onto the system because all of that information would be consumable in a standard way. It would also make it quite a bit easier for each of the systems to talk to each other. Or, you could build a state or country-wide system that was able to talk to each of the individual school systems to collect testing scores. The possibilities are endless.

Brother: And they use the nouns and verbs!

ME: Exactly. Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like.

Brother: So this is what software developers work on now? Deciding how to best model the data?

ME: More or less, this is what engineers do in the web development world, thanks almost entirely to the popularity of RESTful web frameworks like Ruby on Rails.

But this is a very recent change! Just a few years ago, the large majority of developers were busy writing layers of complex specifications for how to access data in a different way that isn't nearly as useful or eloquent. Nouns weren't universal and verbs weren't polymorphic. They basically ignored throwing out decades of real field usage and proven technique and kept starting over with something that looks a lot like other systems that have failed in the past. They used HTTP but only because it let them talk to our network and security people less. It was like trading simplicity for flashy tools and wizards.

Brother: Ewâ€¦Why?

ME: I have no idea.

Brother: But we are done with all that?

ME: We are done. Now, we just tell Rails what we want our data to look like, and it takes care of all of the communication pieces for us. It's a huge boost for productivity!
