# Design web pages with CSS

Css is used to style a HTML page. That could be the
color of a specific text or changing the background of a page.
Like adding some flavor to the blank HTML page.

## Examples

- In order to change store HTML you use the style
  open and close tag

- to change color of a specific text you right call the
  text either by using which tag it is, using the id of a element
  or the class of a element.

- classes are used for multiple elements

- id is used by one specific Element

- To change the color of a text you put  
  color:'The color you want'; inside the style section.

- Also you can link all your css code from another page
  by using  
   /_<link href="Where ever the css at" type="text/css rel="stylesheet"_/

## CSS Layout

- position relative
  Stays in position of normal flow but moves left, right, to or top
- position absolute
  taken out of normal flow and doesn't change surrounding elements.
- position fixed
  when user scrolll down stays in smae spot.
