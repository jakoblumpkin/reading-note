# Operators and Loops

Operators allows to compare to values and
it will return true or false.

## Examples

- == is used to see if two values
  are equal to each other.

- === is used to compare if two
  valus are equal to each other and has the same
  data type.

- != check if two values are not equal to each other.

- !== is used to compare if two
  valus are not equal to each other and has the doesn't have the
  data type.

- < or > both are used to see if one value is greater than the other.

- <= or >= both are used to see if one value is greater than the other or its
  eual to the other.

- && AND is to if both situations are true.

- || OR is used to if either one or the situtions are true.

### For Loops

- for(var i=0; i<10>; i++){

}
As long as the middle section is true it will keep looping.
Every time it loops it adds one to variable i because of i++.
It i varible starts with 0.

### while Loops

var m=9;

- while(m>1){
  m=m-1
  }
  As long as the code in the parenthiesis is true it
  will keep looping around section in {}. It should
  loop around 8 times.
